# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 2: Basic Syntax, Operators, and Data Type Introduction

## 1. Python Syntax Overview
    âœ… Key Points:
       - Case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
       - Indentation (usually 4 spaces) is mandatory in Python.
       - No need for {} or ; like C/C++.
       - Use # for single-line comments and triple quotes (''' or """) for multi-line strings or docstrings
          -  #This is a comment
             print("Hello, Deepak!")  # Indentation is required in blocks

- **Why does Python enforce indentation?**
     - For cleaner syntax and to improve readability. It's part of Python's design philosophy (PEP 8).

## 2. Python Keywords
    These are reserved words and cannot be used as variable names.
        - and, or, not, if, else, elif, while, for, break, continue, def, class, try, except, True, False,    None, is, in, import, pass, return, lambda.
        - import keyword
          print(keyword.kwlist)

## 3. Python Identifiers
    - Valid names for variables, functions, classes.
    - Must begin with a letter (A-Z, a-z) or underscore (_).
    - Cannot start with a digit.
    - Cannot use keywords as identifiers.

## 4. Python Data Types 
        Type	      Example	            Description
        int	          5, -10	              Integer
        float	    3.14, -0.5	           Decimal numbers
        bool	    True, False             Boolean values
        str     	 "Hello"	          Text or characters
        list	     [1, 2, 3]	       Ordered, mutable sequence
        tuple	     (1, 2, 3)	      Ordered, immutable sequence
        dict	     {"a": 1}             	Key-value pairs
        set	         {1, 2, 3}      	Unordered, no duplicates
        None	       None	                Null-like object

##  5. Type Conversion
    ðŸ”¸ Implicit:
        a = 10
        b = 2.5
        print(a + b)  # a becomes float â†’ 12.5

    ðŸ”¸ Explicit (Type Casting):
        x = int("123")     # String â†’ Integer
        y = str(3.14)      # Float â†’ String

**What is the difference between implicit and explicit conversion?**
 - Implicit conversion is done automatically by Python to prevent data loss in operations, while explicit conversion is done manually by the programmer to control how data types are changed.

## 6. Python Operators
  ### A. Arithmetic Operators
         Operator	Example	   Result
            +	     2 + 3	      5
            -	     5 - 2	      3
            *	     4 * 2	      8
            /	     5 / 2     	2.5
            //	    5 // 2	      2  
            %	     5 % 2	      1
            **	    2 ** 3	      8
    
  ### B. Comparison Operators
         ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

  ### C. Logical Operators
         Operator	            Example	                    Meaning
            and	            x > 0 and x < 10	           Both True
            or	             x > 0 or x < 0	              Either True
            not	                not(x > 5)	                Negation

  ### D. Assignment Operators
         x = 5
         x += 1  # x = x + 1
         Also: -=, *=, /=, //=, %= etc.

  ### E. Membership & Identity
         - Membership checks if a value exists within a sequence (in, not in), while identity checks if two variables point to the same object in memory (is, is not)
         - x = [1, 2, 3]  #membership
           print(2 in x)  # True
           
         - a = [1, 2] #Identity
           b = a
           print(a is b)  # True (same object)
