# ðŸ§  SQL for Data Engineering

Welcome to my learning repository for **SQL**, a core skill in the data engineering toolkit. This project documents my journey as I build a deep, practical, and scalable understanding of how SQL is used in the real worldâ€”from writing basic queries to supporting complex data pipelines and analytics workflows.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

- A **centralized knowledge base** for all my SQL learning
- A collection of **clean, structured notes** from courses, projects, and documentation
- A hands-on space for **practicing real-world SQL problems**
- A foundation for applying SQL in **data engineering workflows**, such as ETL pipelines, data modeling, and reporting

While I am currently following **The Complete SQL Bootcamp** on Udemy, this is just one of the many stepping stones toward mastering SQL at scale.

## ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here

### 1. **Curated Notes**
All my SQL notes are written with a long-term perspective, covering concepts in a way that is:
- Easy to revise
- Practical and interview-relevant
- Oriented toward analytics and engineering roles

These notes combine theoretical understanding with hands-on examples.

---

### 2. **Practice Problems**
To solidify understanding, I will create and solve practice problems across different difficulty levels:
- Basic query writing
- Complex joins and subqueries
- Analytical queries and aggregations
- Query optimization techniques

Datasets used will be either:
- Public (Kaggle, Mode, etc.)
- Synthetic (custom-generated)
- Domain-specific (e.g., healthcare, finance, billing)

---

### 3. **Projects & Use Cases**
Real SQL isn't just about solving isolated problemsâ€”it's about solving **business use cases**. This section will include:
- End-to-end SQL projects
- Case studies using real or mock business data
- Integration with tools like Power BI, PostgreSQL, and Streamlit for data storytelling

---

### 4. **Data Engineering Integration (Upcoming)**
As I move beyond the basics, I will incorporate:
- SQL in ETL pipelines (manual + orchestrated with tools like Airflow)
- SQL used with dbt for transformation workflows
- Working with cloud-based data warehouses like BigQuery or Redshift
- Schema design, partitioning, incremental loads, and more
